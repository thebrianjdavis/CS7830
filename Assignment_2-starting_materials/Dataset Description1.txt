This dataset contains follow-up information for individual breast cancer cases.
Features:
	ID: A unique identifier for each case.
	Outcome:
		R: Recurrence of the cancer.
		N: No recurrence of the cancer.
	Time:
		If Outcome = R: Time elapsed until cancer recurrence.
		If Outcome = N: Disease-free time (time elapsed since diagnosis without 				cancer recurrence).
	Cell Nuclei Features:
		For each cell nucleus, ten real-valued features were calculated, describing 		its characteristics:

	Radius: Mean distance from the center to points on the perimeter.
	Texture: Standard deviation of gray-scale values.
	Perimeter: Total length of the cell's boundary.
	Area: Surface area of the cell.
	Smoothness: Local variation in radius lengths.
	Compactness: A measure of shape irregularity (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0).
	Concavity: Severity of concave portions of the cell's contour.
	Concave Points: Number of concave portions of the contour.
	Symmetry: Degree of symmetry in the cell's shape.
	Fractal Dimension: A measure of the cell's complexity (coastline approximation - 1).



	For each of these features, the following were computed:

	Mean: Average value of the feature across all cell nuclei.
	Standard Error: Standard deviation of the feature across all cell nuclei.
	Worst: Mean of the three largest values of the feature.

	Additional Features:

	Tumor Size: Diameter of the excised tumor in centimeters.
	Lymph Node Status: Number of axillary lymph nodes (lymph nodes under the arm) that 			   tested positive for cancer at the time of surgery.
