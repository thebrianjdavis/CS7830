My code was developed in Python 3.11 and the only package used is NumPy.

The version for NumPy I used is in requirements.txt

Run main.py to generate a report called model_output.txt. This report will
contain results for each subtask of the assignment, as well as my notes
describing the results. These notes are what I used to write my short report
as a PDF. I did not create any graphs, but I described the results in the
report since they are all output in the model_output.txt file that is
generated when the code is run.

Running this code will produce warnings (not errors), since the backward
linear regression code produces NaN values.
